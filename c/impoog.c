 * impoog.c - improved "oog"
 * Last update: 03/04/2007
 * Authors: Nathan Mitchell <natem@tir.com> and Lloyd Dilley <lloyd@dilley.me>
 * Description: This small program attempts to fill up the operating system process
 *              table and exhaust physical memory which will make a Linux/Unix system
 *              very slow or even crash. This program should not be used on production
 *              systems. This is only an educational program intended to demonstrate
 *              the need to implement resource limits.
 * Notice: Use at your own risk! The authors accept no responsibility for any problems
 *         that may occur while using this program.
 * License: You may freely distribute this program source code, the compiled program,
 *          and do the same with derivative works with the condition that this license
 *          and the above information in the header (authors, description, and notice)
 *          of this source program, impoog.c, must be kept intact. Furthermore, if you
 *          find this software useful in some way, you can thank the authors by buying
 *          them beers if you ever meet up with them.
